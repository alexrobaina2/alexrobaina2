Hi world 👋 🦄
As a developer, I can generate solutions to problems on the front-end with good practices and a scalable software architecture. I am meticulous with my work, I like creating animations, and modeling pixel perfect apps. I also have back-end knowledge working with non-relational databases, creating Apis with Node.js and Typescript. I like teamwork because it is a way to build great things nimbly.

🔭 I’m currently working on Pets love web app and movile app open source for adopt pets.
🔭 I’m working on datalloger for save data temperature nest bird inside.
🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and Solidity.
🤔 I’m looking for help in open source projects.
🌱 I love plants.
🌱 I love biology.
🏔️ I love climbing
